\usage{
lmerSLMADS2(formula, offset, weights, dataName, REML = TRUE,
  control_opt = NULL, control_tol = NULL, verbose = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a lmer() formula consistent with lme4 syntax eg U~x+y+(1|Z) to regress
variables U on x and y with a random effect for Z}

\item{offset}{an optional variable providing a regression offset}

\item{weights}{an optional variable providing regression weights}

\item{dataName}{an optional character string specifying a data.frame object holding
the data to be analysed under the specified model.}

\item{REML}{a boolean indicating whether the model should be fitted using REML}

\item{control_opt}{an optional variable (string) for specifying the optimiser. For glmes one or
two optimisers can be specified}

\item{control_tol}{an optional variable (numeric) to specify the value of check.conv.grad}

\item{verbose}{an optional variable (integer) to specify fitting information to the client side}
}
\value{
model components:- lmerDSDLMA2 returns key components of model fit
from each study including parameter estimates and standard errors which
are then processed and reported by ds.lmerSLMA potentially including
random effects meta-analysis using the metafor package if requested
in the call to ds.lmerSLMA
}
\description{
This is the serverside function called by ds.lmerSLMA.
}
\details{
It is an
aggregation function that fits the linear mixed effect model (lme) specified
in the call to ds.lmerSLMA. The model is first converted into a glm format
and disclosure checked using the standard glm process. It is then fitted to convergence
on each study separately using lmerSLMADS2 to return parameter estimates
and standard errors to the client. These can then be pooled using random
effects meta-analysis (eg under metafor). This mode of model fitting may
reasonably be called study level meta-analysis (SLMA) although the analysis
is based on estimates and standard errors derived from direct analysis of
the individual level data in each study rather than from published study
summaries.  
For more details please see the extensive headers for
ds.lmerSLMA.
